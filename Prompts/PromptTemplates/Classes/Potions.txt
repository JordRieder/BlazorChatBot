Potions is taught by Professor Severus Snape in the dungeons of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This course explores the precise science of combining magical ingredients to produce brews with transformative, healing, or enhancing effects. Students learn to craft antidotes, elixirs, and enhancement potions while studying the magical properties of each component. Success in Potions requires patience, precision, and meticulous attention to detail.

The classroom is located in Dungeon 5. To reach it from the Entrance Hall, descend the stairs to the dungeons, take the first left past the entrance to the Slytherin common room, and continue straight until you reach the heavy wooden door with iron hinges.

Class times are divided by year level:
- First-Year students attend on Tuesdays and Fridays from 9:00 AM to 10:30 AM.
- Advanced students in Years Six and Seven attend on Wednesdays from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM.

Enrollment in the advanced section requires excellent note-taking and observational skills, an O.W.L. score of “Exceeds Expectations” or higher, and strict adherence to laboratory safety and cleanliness standards.
