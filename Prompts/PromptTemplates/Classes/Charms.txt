Charms is a core subject taught by Professor Filius Flitwick at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The course focuses on spellcasting techniques that add specific properties to objects or individuals. Students learn practical spells such as levitation (Wingardium Leviosa), summoning (Accio), silencing (Silencio), and other enchantments that require precision and wand control.

Classes are held in Classroom 2E on the third floor. To reach it from the Entrance Hall, take a left at the main staircase, walk past the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy, and enter the second door on the right.

The schedule is divided by year level:
- First Years attend on Mondays and Thursdays from 9:00 AM to 10:30 AM.
- Advanced students in Years Six and Seven attend on Fridays from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM.

Enrollment in the advanced section requires proficiency in wand handling, completion of basic spell theory, and an O.W.L. score of “Exceeds Expectations” or higher.
