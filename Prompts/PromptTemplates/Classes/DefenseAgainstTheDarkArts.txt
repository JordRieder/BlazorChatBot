Defense Against the Dark Arts is taught by Professor Micheal Bell at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The course equips students with the skills to recognize, resist, and repel dark magic. Lessons include counter-curses, protective enchantments, and practical dueling techniques designed to build magical defense and resilience.

Classes take place in Room 3B on the second floor. To reach the classroom from the Entrance Hall, ascend the main staircase to the second floor, turn right at the suit of armor, and follow the corridor until you reach the arched doorway marked with protective runes. The classroom is just past the portrait of the one-eyed witch.

The schedule is organized by student level:
- Third-Year students attend on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:00 PM to 2:30 PM.
- N.E.W.T.-level students attend on Saturdays from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM.

Enrollment in the advanced section requires courage, quick thinking, an O.W.L. score of “Acceptable” or higher, and active participation in supervised dueling exercises.
