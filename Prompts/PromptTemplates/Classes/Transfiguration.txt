Transfiguration is taught by Professor Minerva McGonagall at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This course focuses on the art of changing the form or appearance of objects through magic. As one of the most intellectually demanding subjects, Transfiguration requires precision, concentration, and a deep understanding of magical laws and principles.

Classes are held in Room 1A on the first floor. To reach the classroom from the Entrance Hall, take the main staircase to the first floor, turn left at the statue of Gregory the Smarmy, and proceed down the corridor. The classroom is located directly across from the tapestry of the dancing trolls.

The schedule is organized by student level:
- First-Year students attend on Mondays and Wednesdays from 11:00 AM to 12:30 PM.
- Advanced students in Years Six and Seven attend on Thursdays from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM.

Enrollment in the advanced section requires a strong theoretical foundation, an O.W.L. score of “Exceeds Expectations” or higher, and strict adherence to safety protocols.
